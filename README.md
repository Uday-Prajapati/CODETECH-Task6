# Overview:
The code implements a Hospital Management System (HMS) with a GUI interface using Java Swing. It facilitates management tasks such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, health record management, billing, inventory updates, and staff management. The system interacts with a MySQL database to persist data.

# Key Activities:
# 1. Patient Registration:
Allows users to register new patients with details like name, age, address, and contact information.

# 2. Appointment Scheduling:
Enables scheduling appointments for registered patients with specific doctors at a chosen date and time.

# 3. Health Record Management:
Adds health records for patients, including diagnosis and treatment details.

# 4. Billing:
Generates bills for patients, specifying the amount and description of the service.

# 5. Inventory Updates:
Manages hospital inventory by adding items or updating quantities for existing items.

# 6. Staff Management:
Adds new staff members to the system with details like name, position, and salary.

# Technology Used:
# Java Swing:
Provides the graphical user interface (GUI) components for interaction.

# JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):
Establishes a connection between the application and a MySQL database for data storage and retrieval.

# MySQL Database:
Stores data related to patients, appointments, health records, billing, inventory, and staff.

# Key Insights: 
# Error Handling:
Effective use of exception handling to notify users about errors like database connection failures or invalid input.

# Validation Mechanisms:
Includes safeguards to ensure proper data input, like checking for numeric values where needed and ensuring no fields are left empty.

# Scalable Design:
Modular structure allows for easy addition of new features, making the system flexible and adaptable for future needs.

# User-Centric Approach:
The interactive GUI and clear error messages ensure usability and a better user experience.

# Final Output:
# Hospital Management UI
